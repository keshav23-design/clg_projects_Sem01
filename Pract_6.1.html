        This is a paragraph is styled using inline CSS. Only this paragraph is affected.
        Inline CSS is a way to apply styles directly to an HTML element using the style attribute. 
        This means the CSS is written Inside the HTML tag itself. It is the quickest way to apply a style to a 
        single element, but it's not recommended for multiple elements because it mixes content with presentation 
        and can make your code harder to maintain.
